# Exploratory Data Analysis With Python


## Objectives:
The purpose of this test is to assess your ability to handle data analysis tasks using Python. You will be working with a fictional dataset and will be expected to:
- Perform data cleaning to handle missing or incorrect values.
- Conduct feature engineering to create new insights from existing data.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to explore and present data.
- Analyze the dataset to extract meaningful patterns and insights.
- Apply various data analysis techniques to answer specific questions related to the dataset.


## Instructions:

### Data Cleaning:

**Task**: Identify and handle missing values in the 'Sales' and 'Cost' columns. Replace missing values with the mean of their respective columns.  
**Question**: What is the total number of missing values in the dataset before cleaning?  


### Feature Engineering:

**Task**: Create a new column named 'Profit/Loss' that calculates the difference between 'Sales' and 'Cost'.  
**Question**: After creating the 'Profit/Loss' column, what is the average 'Profit/Loss' for product 'A'?  


### Data Visualization:

**Task**: Create a bar chart showing the total 'Sales' for each product across all regions.  
**Question**: Which product has the highest total sales?  


### Profit Analysis:

**Task**: Analyze the 'Profit/Loss' column to determine the most profitable product.  
**Question**: Which product has the highest average 'Profit/Loss' across all regions?  


### Time Series Analysis:

**Task**: Plot the sales trends over time for all products.  
**Question**: Identify any observable trends or seasonality in the sales data.  

### Correlation Analysis:

**Task**: Calculate the correlation between 'Sales', 'Cost', and 'Profit/Loss'.  
**Question**: Which pair of variables has the highest correlation?  


### Filtering and Aggregation:

**Task**: Filter the dataset for sales in the 'North' region and calculate the total profit for this region.  
**Question**: What is the total profit for the 'North' region?  


### Advanced Feature Engineering:

**Task**: Create a new column 'ROI' (Return on Investment) calculated as `(Profit/Loss / Cost) * 100`.  
**Question**: What is the average ROI for product 'B'?  


### Outlier Detection:

**Task**: Identify any outliers in the 'Sales' column using a boxplot.  
**Question**: How many outliers are present in the 'Sales' data?  


### Final Analysis:

**Task**: Provide a summary of your findings, including the key insights from your analysis. Mention any patterns, trends, or anomalies you discovered in the data.  
**Question**: Based on your analysis, which product would you recommend for increased focus in sales strategies and why?  
**Hint**: Synthesize the results from all your analyses to form a conclusion.
